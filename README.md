# Odin Landing Page

This is the repo for my second project in The Odin Project's Foundation path. The goal of this project is to create a landing page with a predetermined design. I have add personal touches to the images and text.

After finishing this project, I have learned multiple CSS techniques, especially those regarding flex box, as well as improving my HTML knowledge.
